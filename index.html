            <h3>Day 1 (07 Jan 2026)</h3>
            <p>In the first class, we learned how to give a proper self-introduction and speak with confidence. Ma’am guided us about correct tone, clarity, and the important points to include while introducing ourselves. The session helped me understand how to present myself clearly and confidently in front of others.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Day 2 (14 Jan 2026)</h3>
            <p>In the second class, ma’am taught us how to give a proper introduction. First, we should greet the audience and tell our name, followed by our work experience and achievements. After that, we should mention our educational qualifications, projects, skills, and strengths.

Then we learned about PESTLE issues. PESTLE stands for Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental factors. These factors help us understand the external environment that affects an organization or situation.
            </p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Day 3 (21 Jan 2026)</h3>
            <p>In the third class, we completed a self-profiling sheet given by ma’am. Through this activity, we learned many things about ourselves. The questions helped us identify our strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and threats, and also showed us the areas where we need to improve.

We also understood the soft skills we possess and the types of questions that interviewers may ask. Ma’am guided us on how to give clear and precise answers during an interview. While we were presenting our responses, she corrected our mistakes and explained how we could further improve our answers and communication.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Day 4 (28 Jan 2026)</h3>
            <p>In the fourth class, we continued with the remaining profile questions. Ma’am corrected our answers, and I learned how to make my responses more precise. By attempting the questions in the classroom, I was able to do my SWOT analysis properly. Listening to other students’ answers also helped me improve and correct my own responses.

Ma’am also taught us about presentation skills — what a presentation is, how we should stand while giving a presentation, and how important non-verbal communication is for delivering an effective presentation. She also explained what our attire should be for a presentation and what type of word selection we should use during the presentation.</p>
        
        </div>
         <div class="card">
            <h3>Day 5 (04 feb 2026)</h3>
            <p>In the fifth class, different groups presented on various topics. The first group spoke about the impact of political stability and explained why a stable government is important for a country’s growth and for the safety and development of its people. The second group discussed society’s obsession with marks and money and taught that true success also includes skills, creativity, and happiness. The third group explained deepfake technology and how it can create fake videos and reduce trust in digital content. The last group presented cybercrime and cyber law, helping us understand how to stay safe online. Ma’am also gave feedback to improve our presentation skills.
            </p>
    </div>
     <div class="card">
            <h3>Day 6 (11 feb 2026)</h3>
            <p>In the sixth class, the remaining groups gave their presentations. The first group spoke about unemployment and skills in India, explaining that unemployment occurs not only because of fewer jobs but also due to a lack of practical skills. The second group discussed social media and its impact on youth, highlighting both its benefits and its negative effects on mental health and productivity. The third group presented environmental issues in India, such as pollution, deforestation, and climate change, and stressed the need for eco-friendly habits. Ma’am also shared feedback on improving presentations, including maintaining eye contact, proper attire, and using simple, non-bright colours in PPT slides.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
            <h3>Day 7 (18 feb 2026)</h3>
            <p>In the seventh class, ma’am explained how to prepare a good portfolio by showing examples of seniors’ portfolios. This helped me understand what important details and documents should be included. She also revised presentation guidelines, including proper attire combinations suitable for interviews, such as black, blue, or brown formal wear. Ma’am again emphasized the importance of non-verbal communication and maintaining proper eye contact while speaking.

Later, some students conducted a JAM (Just A Minute) activity where each student spoke for one minute on an instant topic. This activity improved my confidence, helped me think quickly, and prepared me better for interviews. </p>
